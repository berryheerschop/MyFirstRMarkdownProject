# Introduction

Why learn R?   

- For fun  
- Gaining experience in data science  
- Getting a feel for a different data tool  

~~is this striked through?~~

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**Structure of dataframe Cars**
```{r cars}
str(cars)

```

**Summary of cars dataframe**
```{r}
summary(cars)

```
**Summary of pressure dataframe**
```{r}
summary(pressure)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
